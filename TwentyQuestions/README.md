# Twenty Questions Game
A basic web application that allows the user to play a game of 20 questions on the computer. 
This computer asks the user a series of questions trying to guess what the user is thinking of. 
If it guesses right, the computer wins, if it runs out of questions, the player wins! 
If the computer runs out of questions, it will prompt the user to add a question that would result in the word they were thinking of. 
After doing this, a JSON file containing the computer's "knowledge" is downloaded. 
Players may upload this file to the 20 Questions game to play it again with a "smarter" computer opponent.
